  \item Harmonic Oscillator

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Classical

        $$F=-kx$$
        $$V(x)=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
        $$F=-\frac{dV}{dx}$$

      \item Quantum

        $$E=\frac{p^2}{2m}+\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
        $$H=\frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m}+\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2\hat{x}^2$$
        $$\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Energy eigenvalues can be found as:

            $$E_n=\hbar\omega(n+1/2)$$

          \item We may find:

            $$H=\hbar\omega(aa^{\dagger}+1/2)$$

          \item And from here, we find:

            $$[a,a^{\dagger}]=1$$

            \begin{itemize}

              \item This indicates that the operators $a$ and $a^{\dagger}$ raise and lower the energy eigenstates

              \item We can write this as:

                $$a\ket{E}\propto \ket{E-\hbar\omega}$$
                $$a^{\dagger}\ket{E}\propto \ket{E+\hbar\omega}$$

              \item These are called ``ladder operators''

              \item Note that there is an asymmetry in the ladder, since $aa^{\dagger}\neq a^{\dagger}a$

              \item Since there is a lowest energy state in the harmonic oscillator well, states can not be lowered in energy indefinitely, such that:

                $$a\ket{E_{lowest}}=0$$

              \item This is called the ladder termination condition

                $$H\ket{E_{lowest}}=\hbar\omega(aa^{\dagger}+1/2)\ket{E_{lowest}}=\frac{\hbar\omega}{2}\ket{E_{lowest}}$$

              \item Thus, we may conclude that the lowest energy is $\hbar\omega/2$

              \item Since this is finite, we say the quantum mechanical ground state has a zero-point energy of $\hbar\omega/2$

            \end{itemize}
