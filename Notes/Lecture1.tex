\begin{itemize}

  \item Key Features of Quantum Mechanics

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Probabilistic outcome of measurements

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Compute probabilities \underline{exactly}, and that is the most complete information possible

        \end{itemize}

      \item Dual wave-particle nature of mature

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Which one we observe depends on the experiment performed

        \end{itemize}

      \item Conjugate variables (from classical mechanics) develop ``uncertainty'' relations

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Wave theory relation:

            $$\Delta x\Delta p\geq \hbar$$
            $$\Delta E \Delta t\geq \hbar$$

          \item Classical mechanics is ``contained'' in Quantum mechanics, which includes classical electricity and magnetism

        \end{itemize}

      \item Every particle and object built from particles, including light, falls into one of two classes:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Fermions (spin is any odd multiple of $\hbar/2$)

            \begin{itemize}
                
              \item Electrons are an example

            \end{itemize}

          \item Bosons (spin is an integer multiple of $\hbar$, including 0)

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Photons are an example

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item The properties of Quantum mechanics not falling into features 1-4 are largely familiar from classical physics

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Similar but Different

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Every electron has \underline{exactly} the same spin, charge, and mass

      \item Every photon has \underline{exactly} the same spin, charge, and mass

      \item This indicates no inequality among particles of the same type

    \end{itemize}

  \item Time-Evolution in Quantum Mechanics

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Time-evolution is given by the Hamiltonian, $\mathcal{H}$

      \item Hamilton's Equations give us:

        $$\frac{d\vec{q}}{dt}=\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial \vec{p}}$$

      \item We may write the Hamiltonian as:

        $$\mathcal{H}=\frac{\vec{p}^2}{2m}\longrightarrow \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial \vec{p}}=\frac{\vec{p}}{m}=\vec{v}$$

      \item Alternatively, we may write the force as:

        $$\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=-\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial\vec{q}}$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Stern-Gerlach Experiments

    \begin{itemize}
        
      \item Took place in 1922 with Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach

      \item The act of observing a quantum particle affects its measurable properties in a way foreign to our experience

      \item The experiment looks like this:

          \caption{Set Up of Stern-Gerlach Experiment}
          \label{fig:1}
        \end{figure}

      \item Assuming an atom has a monopole moment, $\vec{\mu}$, the potential energy of the interaction with a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is $E=\vec{\mu}\vec{B}$

      \item Consider a classical description of the atom's moment:

        $$\mu=IA$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where $I$ is the electrical current and $A$ is the area of the loop

        \end{itemize}

      \item A particle of charge $q$ traveling at speed $v$ in a circle of radius $r$ gives us:

        $$\mu=\frac{qvr}{2}=\frac{qL}{2m}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where $L=mvr$ is the orbitable angular momentum

        \end{itemize}

      \item Particles carry an intrinsic angular momentum, $\vec{S}$, called spin

        $$\vec{\mu}=\frac{gq\vec{S}}{2m}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where $g$ is the gyroscopic ratio

        \end{itemize}

      \item Noting that silver atoms were used is important, as different atoms give different results. Considering the shell filling of silver, we know that it extends to a singular atom in the $5s$ shell.

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Since the mass of the nucleus $\geq 2000m_e$, we find a ratio of magnetic moments as:

            $$\frac{\vec{\mu}_{nuc}}{\vec{\mu}_{e^-}}<<1$$

          \item Hence, we have $\vec{\mu}_{\text{Ag}}=-g\dfrac{e}{2m_e}\vec{S}$, where $e$ is the magnitude of an electron's charge

          \item This produces a force of $F_z=-g\dfrac{e}{2m_e}S_z\cdot\dfrac{2B_z}{2z}$

          \item Thus, the deflection of the beam in the Stern-Gerlach experiment is a measure of the projection of the intrinsic spin onto the $z$-axis

          \item Note, the heat of the oven randomizes the direction of $\vec{\mu}$, and, classicly, we have $S_z=|\vec{S}|\cos(\theta)$ and should be continuous over an $S_z$ range given by: $-|\vec{S}|\leq S_z\leq |\vec{S}|$

            \begin{itemize}

              \item But, only two beams are observed!

                \begin{itemize}

                  \item Only two $S_z$ components are possible, since $S_z=\pm \hbar/2$

                \end{itemize}

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item We know:

        $$\hbar\approx=1.0546\cdot10^{-34}[\si{\joule\second}]=6.5821\cdot10^{-16}[\si{eV\second}]$$

        $$\hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}\text{ (Planck's Constant)}$$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
