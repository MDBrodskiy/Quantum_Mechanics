\begin{itemize}

  \item Key Features of Quantum Mechanics

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Probabilistic outcome of measurements

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Compute probabilities \underline{exactly}, and that is the most complete information possible

        \end{itemize}

      \item Dual wave-particle nature of mature

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Which one we observe depends on the experiment performed

        \end{itemize}

      \item Conjugate variables (from classical mechanics) develop ``uncertainty'' relations

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Wave theory relation:

            $$\Delta x\Delta p\geq \hbar$$
            $$\Delta E \Delta t\geq \hbar$$

          \item Classical mechanics is ``contained'' in Quantum mechanics, which includes classical electricity and magnetism

        \end{itemize}

      \item Every particle and object built from particles, including light, falls into one of two classes:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Fermions (spin is any odd multiple of $\hbar/2$)

            \begin{itemize}
                
              \item Electrons are an example

            \end{itemize}

          \item Bosons (spin is an integer multiple of $\hbar$, including 0)

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Photons are an example

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item The properties of Quantum mechanics not falling into features 1-4 are largely familiar from classical physics

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Similar but Different

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Every electron has \underline{exactly} the same spin, charge, and mass

      \item Every photon has \underline{exactly} the same spin, charge, and mass

      \item This indicates no inequality among particles of the same type

    \end{itemize}

  \item Time-Evolution in Quantum Mechanics

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Time-evolution is given by the Hamiltonian, $\mathcal{H}$

      \item Hamilton's Equations give us:

        $$\frac{d\vec{q}}{dt}=\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial \vec{p}}$$

      \item We may write the Hamiltonian as:

        $$\mathcal{H}=\frac{\vec{p}^2}{2m}\longrightarrow \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial \vec{p}}=\frac{\vec{p}}{m}=\vec{v}$$

      \item Alternatively, we may write the force as:

        $$\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=-\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial\vec{q}}$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Stern-Gerlach Experiments

    \begin{itemize}
        
      \item Took place in 1922 with Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach

      \item The act of observing a quantum particle affects its measurable properties in a way foreign to our experience

      \item The experiment looks like this:

          \caption{Set Up of Stern-Gerlach Experiment}
          \label{fig:1}
        \end{figure}

      \item Assuming an atom has a monopole moment, $\vec{\mu}$, the potential energy of the interaction with a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is $E=\vec{\mu}\vec{B}$

      \item Consider a classical description of the atom's moment:

        $$\mu=IA$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where $I$ is the electrical current and $A$ is the area of the loop

        \end{itemize}

      \item A particle of charge $q$ traveling at speed $v$ in a circle of radius $r$ gives us:

        $$\mu=\frac{qvr}{2}=\frac{qL}{2m}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where $L=mvr$ is the orbitable angular momentum

        \end{itemize}

      \item Particles carry an intrinsic angular momentum, $\vec{S}$, called spin

        $$\vec{\mu}=\frac{gq\vec{S}}{2m}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where $g$ is the gyroscopic ratio

        \end{itemize}

      \item Noting that silver atoms were used is important, as different atoms give different results. Considering the shell filling of silver, we know that it extends to a singular atom in the $5s$ shell.

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Since the mass of the nucleus $\geq 2000m_e$, we find a ratio of magnetic moments as:

            $$\frac{\vec{\mu}_{nuc}}{\vec{\mu}_{e^-}}<<1$$

          \item Hence, we have $\vec{\mu}_{\text{Ag}}=-g\dfrac{e}{2m_e}\vec{S}$, where $e$ is the magnitude of an electron's charge

          \item This produces a force of $F_z=-g\dfrac{e}{2m_e}S_z\cdot\dfrac{2B_z}{2z}$

          \item Thus, the deflection of the beam in the Stern-Gerlach experiment is a measure of the projection of the intrinsic spin onto the $z$-axis

          \item Note, the heat of the oven randomizes the direction of $\vec{\mu}$, and, classicly, we have $S_z=|\vec{S}|\cos(\theta)$ and should be continuous over an $S_z$ range given by: $-|\vec{S}|\leq S_z\leq |\vec{S}|$

            \begin{itemize}

              \item But, only two beams are observed!

                \begin{itemize}

                  \item Only two $S_z$ components are possible, since $S_z=\pm \hbar/2$

                \end{itemize}

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item We know:

        $$\hbar\approx=1.0546\cdot10^{-34}[\si{\joule\second}]=6.5821\cdot10^{-16}[\si{eV\second}]$$

        $$\hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}\text{ (Planck's Constant)}$$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item This indicates a quantization of an electron's intrinsic angular momentum along the $z$ axis

          \item In the case that $S_z=+\hbar/2$, we call this spin ``up''

          \item In the case that $S_z=-\hbar/2$, we call this spin ``down''

          \item The quantity $S_z$ itself is called an ``observable''

          \item The device depicted within the Stern-Gerlach experiment is called an ``analyzer'', since it sorts the input into two possible outputs

          \item New notation: $S_z=+\hbar/2$ can be written in Dirac notation as:

            $$\ket{+\frac{\hbar}{2}}\Longrightarrow \ket{+}$$

          \item The negative (down) spin becomes:

            $$\ket{-\frac{\hbar}{2}}\Longrightarrow \ket{-}$$

          \item A ``ket'' can be depicted as follows:

            $$\ket{\cdot}$$

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Or, in its general form:

            $$\ket{\psi}$$

            \end{itemize}

          \item Note that for up and down spin, occasionally one may encounter:

            $$\ket{+}=\ket{\uparrow}$$
            $$\ket{-}=\ket{\downarrow}$$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Experiment 1:

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \include{Figures/Stern-Gerlach2}
          \caption{Experimental Setup}
          \label{fig:2}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Although both Stern-Gerlach analyzers in the experiment are the same, they play different roles

            \begin{itemize}

              \item The first analyzer prepares the beam and the second analyzer measures the beam

              \item The first analyzer is often referred to as a state preparation device

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item Experiment 2:

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \include{Figures/Stern-Gerlach3}
          \caption{Experimental Setup}
          \label{fig:3}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{itemize}

          \item The second analyzer is rotated by $90^{\circ}$ with respect to the first and aligned with the $x$-axis

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Only two possible outputs from second analyzer

              \item Results would be unchanged if we used the lower part of the first analyzer

              \item One can not predict which of the second analyzer parts any particular atom will emerge from

              \item These results highlight the probablistic nature of quantum mechanics; quantum mechanics is a complete description of reality (as far as we know)

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item Experiment 3:

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \include{Figures/Stern-Gerlach4}
          \caption{Experimental Setup}
          \label{fig:4}
        \end{figure}
    
        \begin{itemize}

          \item This tells us that the $S_x$ and $S_z$ are incompatible observables, which means we can not know the values of both simultaneously

        \end{itemize}

      \item Experiment 4:

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \include{Figures/Stern-Gerlach5a}
          \caption{Experimental Setup Part One}
          \label{fig:5}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \include{Figures/Stern-Gerlach5b}
          \caption{Experimental Setup Part Two}
          \label{fig:6}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \include{Figures/Stern-Gerlach5c}
          \caption{Experimental Setup Part Three}
          \label{fig:7}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Results are akin to the double slit experiment and destructive interference

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
